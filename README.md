# rpg_cordova
A turn based RPG using cordova for mobile.

Built using only HTML5, CSS3, JS (Ecmasript 6), and JQuery. Designed with object oriented programming in mind from the start to allow for
flexibility and expandability.

Development schedule is in phases:

**Phase 1: First and simplest MVP**

Just one character and one monster, in which player and monster take turns.  One tile per move and one hit kill.
Player controls by clicking on tile around character. Monster moves randomly but attacks player if it's one tile away.
Game ends when either player or monster is dead.

*Completed*

**Phase 2: First actual game**

One character with two types of monsters, a Queen and minions.  The Queen moves one tile at a time in random direction
and spawns a minion each turn it can move but can't attack. Minions move two tiles at a time (both in same direction) in random direction
and attacks player if next to it.  All monsters move after player moves.
Game ends when either player or all monsters are dead.

*In progress*

**Phase 3: More advanced game** (features not finalized)
